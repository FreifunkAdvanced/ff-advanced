Collection of unpriorized ToDos, for a Roadmap see ROADMAP file

- fake name server (better than current approach: use more than one IP
  to distinguish between different hosts)
- modified httpd that stays silent when non-http traffic comes in (to
  prevent breaking buggy non-http applications)
- periodically check for stale gwip entries
  - especially check if own node has a stale entry (this is easier)
- correct susupgrade (protect node-id, discard crontab)
- add (DNS) address for node self service portal
- better URL redirection schemes
  - javascript based?
  - or transparent proxy?
- routable IPv6
- adapt splash_click for mobile browsers ("weiter zu" is too small)
- reintegrate N2N
- use VPN to tunnel all internet access
  - VPN/no-VPN variable?
  - with some auto-config for the VPN
- use iproute2 (from busybox) to replace `ifconfig ...|grep ...`
- call `fsm watch inetable` once eth cable is plugged in/out
