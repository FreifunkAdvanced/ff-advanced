* p2ptbl schema
  The value fields (2,...) are comma-separated (instead of tab)
  because otherwise empty fields would confuse the p2ptbl (multiple
  tabs collapsed to one during sh read)

  1. MAC (in capital letters)
  2. name :: dns compatible host name or empty (=none)
  3. inet_mode :: bridged | routed | isolated or empty (=default,
     depending on client medium)
  4. splash disabled :: true | false or empty (=false)
  5. static_ip :: static IPv4 or empty (=none)
